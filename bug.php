This code suffers from a potential issue related to type juggling in PHP. The comparison `$a == $b` uses loose comparison, meaning PHP will attempt to convert the operands to the same type before comparison. This can lead to unexpected results when comparing numeric strings with integers. For example, '10' == 10 evaluates to true.  This is often a source of subtle and hard-to-find bugs, especially when dealing with user inputs or data fetched from external sources where type consistency isn't guaranteed. 
```php
<?php
$a = '10';
$b = 10;
if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Values are equal (loose comparison)";
} else {
  echo "Values are not equal (loose comparison)";
}

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "\nValues are equal (strict comparison)";
} else {
  echo "\nValues are not equal (strict comparison)";
}
?>
```
